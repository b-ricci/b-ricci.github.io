The borough of McCandless, Pennsylvania, officially opened its much anticipated baseball field,
<strong> Diamond Run Field </strong>, on Saturday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony, youth clinic, and an evening
scrimmage game. The new field sits next to Devlin Community Park and was designed to serve
players of all ages and abilities.

Diamond Run Field includes a fenced little league field, covered dugouts, lights for evening games, spectator seating and concession stands. McCandless township officials worked with the local baseball leagues to build a layout that supports both recreational play and regional tournaments. McCandless Recreation Director Tom Smith explained,<q>this field is for everyone, from first-time players to longtime fans.</q>

Volunteers and local businesses contributed materials and labor to get the project completed. There are currently plans for spring clinics and an adult summer league. The field will also host a regional Little League qualifier in which the winner will earn a spot in the Little League World Series. Many residents left the opening day feeling proud of their community and what this field signifies for young people in the area. One volunteer said <em>she's never seen so many kids smiling at once</em>.
